		<h1>All About me!</h1>

		<img src="pexels-pixabay-417054.jpg" alt="picture of Golden Gate Bridge"/>
		<p>Some information about me is that I was born in San Francisco. It really is a beautiful city,
            but not the best place to live. It's over run with tourists and pretty cold. I really like eating 
            spicy food. I also like traveling but I haven't been too many places. I hope to travel more in the future. 
            Some of my skills are:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Multilingualism</li>
			<li>Problem Solving</li>
			<li>Communication</li>
		  </ul>
